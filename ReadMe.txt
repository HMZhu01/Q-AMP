Matlab implementation of the Q-AMP algorithm.

Our implementations based on the D-AMP_Toolbox, BM3D, and Matconvnet codes, whose contents can be downloaded from:
D-AMP_Toolbox: https://github.com/ricedsp/D-AMP_Toolbox
BM3D: http://www.cs.tut.fi/~foi/GCF-BM3D/
Matconvnet: http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/
